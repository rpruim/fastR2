\title{Concrete Compressive Strength Data}
\format{
\code{Concrete} is a data frame with the following 
variables.
\itemize{ 
\item{limestone}{ percentage of limestone}
\item{water}{ water-cement ratio}
\item{strength}{ compressive strength (MPa) after 28 days}
}

\code{concreteAll} is a data frame with the following 9 variables.
\itemize{ \item{cement}{ amount of cement (kg/m^3)}
\item{slag}{ amount of blast furnace slag (kg/m^3)}
\item{ash}{ amount of fly ash(kg/m^3)} 
\item{water}{ amount of water (kg/m^3)} 
\item{superP}{ amount of superplasticizer (kg/m^3)}
\item{coarseAg}{ amount of coarse aggregate (kg/m^3)}
\item{fineAg}{ amount of fine aggregate (kg/m^3)}
\item{age}{ age of concrete in days }
\item{strength}{ compressive strength measured in MPa} }
\code{Concrete} is a subset of \code{ConcreteAll}.

\description{
These data were collected by I-Cheng Yeh to determine how the compressive
strength of concrete is related to its ingredients (cement, blast furnace
slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine
aggregate) and age.
