\title{Pendulum data}
\format{
A data frame with 27 observations on the following 3 variables.
\itemize{ \item{length}{ length of the pendulum (in meters)}
\item{period}{ average time of period (in seconds) over several
swings of the pendulum} \item{delta.length}{ an estimate of the
accuracy of the length measurement} }
}

Calvin College physics students under the direction of Professor
Steve Plath.

\description{
Period and pendulum length for a number of string and mass pendulums
constructed by physics students.  The same mass was used throughout, but the
length of the string was varied from 10cm to 16 m.
