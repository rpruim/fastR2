\description{
The results from a study comparing different preparation methods for taste
test samples.
}
\details{
The samples were prepared for tasting using either a coarse screen or a fine
screen, and with either a high or low liquid content. A total taste score is
recorded for each of 16 groups of 50 testers each. Each group had 25 men and
25 women, each of whom scored the samples on a scale from -3 (terrible) to 3
(excellent).  The sum of these individual scores is the overall taste score
for the group.
