\title{New England traffic fatalities (1951-1959)}
\format{
A data frame with 9 observations on the following 6 variables.
\describe{ 
\item{year}{ a year from 1951 to 1959}
\item{cn.deaths}{ number of traffic deaths in Connecticut}
\item{ny}{ deaths per 100,000 in New York} 
\item{cn}{ deaths per 100,000 in Connecticut} 
\item{ma}{ deaths per 100,000 in  Massachusetts} 
\item{ri}{ deaths per 100,000 in in Rhode Island} }

\description{
Used by Tufte as an example of the importance of context, these data show
the traffic fatality rates in New England in the 1950s.  Connecticut
increased enforcement of speed limits in 1956.  In their full context, it is
difficult to say if the decline in Connecticut traffic fatalities from 1955
to 1956 can be attributed to the stricter enforcement.
