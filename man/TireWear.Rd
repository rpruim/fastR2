\title{Estimating tire wear}
\format{
A data frame with 16 observations on the following 2 variables.
\describe{ 
\item{weight}{ estimated wear (1000's of miles) base on
weight loss} 
\item{groove}{ estimated wear (1000's of miles) based on
groove wear} }
}
\source{
These data are available at DASL, the Data and Story Library

}
\description{
Tread wear is estimated by two methods: weight loss and groove wear.
