\description{
William Gosset analyzed data from an experiment comparing the yield of
regular and kiln-dried corn.
}
\details{
Gosset (Student) reported on the results of seeding plots with two different
kinds of seed. Each type of seed (regular and kiln-dried) was planted in
adjacent plots, accounting for 11 pairs of "split" plots.

\examples{

Corn2 <- stack(Corn)
names(Corn2) <- c('yield','treatment')
lm(yield ~ treatment, data = Corn2)
t.test(yield ~ treatment, data = Corn2)
t.test(Corn$reg, Corn$kiln)
