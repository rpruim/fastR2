\description{
Subjects were students in grades 4-6 from three school districts in
Michigan. Students were selected from urban, suburban, and rural school
districts with approximately 1/3 of their sample coming from each district.
Students indicated whether good grades, athletic ability, or popularity was
most important to them.  They also ranked four factors: grades, sports,
looks, and money, in order of their importance for popularity.  The
questionnaire also asked for gender, grade level, and other demographic
information.
