#' Cooling muscles with ice
#' 
#' This data set contains the results of an experiment comparing the efficacy
#' of different forms of dry ice application in reducing the temperature of the
#' calf muscle.
#' 
#' The 12 subjects in this study came three times, at least four days apart,
#' and received one of three ice treatments (cubed ice, crushed ice, or ice
#' mixed with water). In each case, the ice was prepared in a plastic bag and
#' applied dry to the subjects calf muscle.  The temperature measurements were
#' taken on the skin surface and inside the calf muscle (via a 4 cm long probe)
#' every 30 seconds for 20 minutes prior to icing, for 20 minutes during icing,
#' and for 2 hours after the ice had been removed.  The temperature
#' measurements are stored in variables that begin with \code{b} (baseline),
#' \code{t} (treatment), or \code{r} (recovery) followed by a numerical code
#' for the elapsed time formed by concatenating the number of minutes and

#' Paper airplanes
#' 
#' Student-collected data from an experiment investigating the design of paper
#' airplanes.
#' 
#' These data were collected by Stewart Fischer and David Tippetts, statistics
#' students at the Queensland University of Technology in a subject taught by
#' Dr. Margaret Mackisack. Here is their description of the data and its
#' collection:
#' 
#' The experiment decided upon was to see if by using two different designs of
#' paper aeroplane, how far the plane would travel. In considering this, the
#' question arose, whether different types of paper and different angles of
#' release would have any effect on the distance travelled. Knowing that paper
#' aeroplanes are greatly influenced by wind, we had to find a way to eliminate
#' this factor. We decided to perform the experiment in a hallway of the
#' University, where the effects of wind can be controlled to some extent by
#' closing doors.
#' 
#' In order to make the experimental units as homogeneous as possible we
#' allocated one person to a task, so person 1 folded and threw all planes,
#' person 2 calculated the random order assignment, measured all the distances,
#' checked that the angles of flight were right, and checked that the plane
#' release was the same each time.
#' 
#' The factors that we considered each had two levels as follows:
#' 
#' Paper: A4 size, 80g and 50g
#' 
#' Design: High Performance Dual Glider, and Incredibly Simple Glider (patterns
#' attached to original report)
#' 
#' Angle of release: Horizontal, or 45 degrees upward.
#' 
#' The random order assignment was calculated using the random number function
#' of a calculator. Each combination of factors was assigned a number from one
#' to eight, the random numbers were generated and accordingly the order of the
#' experiment was found.

#' Pass the Pigs
#' 
#' This data set contains information collected from rolling the pair of pigs
#' (found in the game "Pass the Pigs") 6000 times.
#' 

#' 
#' In "Pass the Pigs", players roll two pig-shaped rubber dice and earn or lose
#' points depending on the configuration of the rolled pigs. Players compete
#' individually to earn 100 points.  On each turn, a player rolls he or she
#' decides to stop or until "pigging out" or
#' 
#' The pig configurations and their associated scores are
#' 
#' 1 = Dot Up (0)

#' 
#' 7 = Pigs are touching one another (-1; lose all points)
#' 
#' One pig Dot Up and one Dot Down ends the turn (a "pig out") and results in 0
#' points for the turn.  If the pigs touch, the turn is ended and all points
#' for the game must be forfeited. Two pigs in the Dot Up or Dot Down
#' configuration score 1 point.  Otherwise, The scores of the two pigs in
#' different configurations are added together. The score is doubled if both
#' both pigs have the same configuration, so, for example, two Snouters are

#' 
#' According to Rex Boggs:

#' I had a hypothesis that the daily weight of my bar of soap [in grams] in my

#' of soap at the end of its life seemed to hang around for just about ever. I

#' 
#' Also I had recently bought some digital kitchen scales and felt I needed to

#' of soap might be dependent upon surface area, and hence would be a quadratic

#' of stepping: 14 steps/min. (coded as \code{slow}), 21 steps/min. (coded as
