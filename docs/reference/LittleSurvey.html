<p>7.1. Suppose that you have decided to see a play for which the admission charge is $20 per ticket.

<p>8.1. suppose that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease that is
    expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed.
    Assume that the exact scientific estimates of the consequences of the programs are as follows:
    If program A is adopted, 200 people will be saved.
    If program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that 600 people will be saved
    and a 2/3 probability that nobody will be saved.
    Which of the two programs would you favor?</p>

<p>9.1. A national survey of college students revealed that professors at this college assign
"significantly more homework that the nationwide average for an institution of its type."
How does this finding compare with your experience?
